# SMS Spam Detection Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model for detecting SMS spam. The model analyzes text messages and classifies them as either spam or not spam (ham). The goal is to provide an effective tool to filter out unwanted messages and improve user experience with SMS communication.

## Project Description

The SMS Spam Detection Model utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. By training on a dataset of labeled messages, the model aims to accurately identify and filter out unwanted spam messages.

## Features

- Implements natural language processing for text analysis.
- Uses machine learning algorithms for spam classification.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for detecting spam messages.
- Supports integration into existing messaging systems or applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model includes a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. This labeled dataset is essential for training a robust machine learning model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and spam messages.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install these dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git

## Navigate to the project directory:
cd sms-spam-detection

## Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the SMS Spam Detection Model:

Run the application:

python detect_spam.py

Input the text message you want to classify.

Obtain the classification result (spam or ham).

## Model Training
If you want to train the model with your own data:

Replace the existing dataset with your data in the data directory.

Modify the data preprocessing and model training scripts as needed.

Run the training script:

python train_model.py

## Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation results are displayed during the model training process.
